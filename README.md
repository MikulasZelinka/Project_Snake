 ## Installation:
 To launch the project install Python and then download the .py file from the repository. 
 
 After a successful download just launch the file.
 ## Usage:
 To play the game just run the .py file and turn using Arrow keys 
 
 Collect green dots (with some imagination poisonous apples) to grow your snake and avoid the obstacles.
 ## Built with:
 * [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - The main library used
 ## Known Issues:
 new issue: Only one key will be registered as an input per tick -> future feature: remember multiple inputs
  
 Just a boring old snake without any extra features right now
 
 Documentation in file missing
 ##### Solved:
 * ###### Keys aren't fully responsive (dont know if that's Pygame problem)
 * ###### game OVER happens when multiple keys that would consequently kill snake are pressed but the game doesnt
 
 ## Planning to add:
 Barrier blocks
 
 Negative effects
 
 Different levels maybe?
 
 Using mouse to control the snake (Is it even possible?)
 
 ## Credit:
 To my sister Gabriela who is the author of all the music used.
 
 To all of the people online that came with much better implementation that I originally thought was good.
